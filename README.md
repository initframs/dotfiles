## fastfetch
based on rose pine theme

2 configs are provided- `config.jsonc` and `config-smol.jsonc`. the regular config has more info and uses the large logo, while the small config is better if terminal space is limited and you just need core info

desktop users might want to swap out the `battery` key with `gpu` or something else
